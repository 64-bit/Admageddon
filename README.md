# Admageddon
Computer vison based adblock.

I've pretty much had it with seeing advertisments and corporate logos everywhere.
This project is an attempt to create a machine learning model to visually block ads,
with the hope someday of running it on a AR device and just elmiinitating the possibliity of ever seeing an ad.

It's time for an advertisng armageddon.
